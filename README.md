# CONTINUAL-LEARNING-DISCOVERSE

Based on the DISCOVERSE project, we trained the ACT model using data collected from simulation, 3DGS scenarios, and real-world scenarios, and deployed it on the actual robot. We tested our quantized model on the D-Robotics RDK X5, and it was able to perform inference. We also attempted to deploy the diffusion policy and the PPO+ACT method, but the results were not satisfactory.
